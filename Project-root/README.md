Hey team! 👋

I've set up a project structure for our web project that I think will help us stay organized and efficient. Here's a breakdown of our folder structure:

📁Project-root
    📁Assets            # All our static assets live here
        📁css           # Stylesheets go here
        📁images        # Image files for the project
        📁js            # JavaScript files
    📁DatabaseConnection # Database connection scripts and configs
    📁includes          # Reusable PHP components and functions
    📁pages             # Individual page files (PHP or HTML)
    📄index.html        # Main entry point of our website
    📄README.md         # Project documentation
    📄schema.sql        # Database schema file

Key points to remember:
1. Keep all static assets (CSS, JS, images) in the 'Assets' folder.
2. Use 'DatabaseConnection' for anything related to our database setup.
3. Put reusable code snippets or functions in the 'includes' directory.
4. Individual pages of our site go in the 'pages' folder.
5. Always keep the README.md updated with important project info.

This structure should help us maintain a clean and organized codebase. It's designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. 

Remember, this is our starting point. If you have ideas for improvements or if you find any pain points as we develop, please speak up! We can always adjust to make our workflow better.

Let's build something awesome together! 💪🚀
